My expectation for CMSC 100 is that it will bootstrap myself in 
web development with skills that complements the pre-acquired ones 
from previous courses like CMSC 12 and 22. I expect the course to 
discuss topics that covers full-stack development and some about 
databases specific to web dev use. I'm also looking forward to work 
in a team to explore different insights about the course and its 
application in our field.

I agree with your expectations since they align with mine as well. 
Developing full-stack development skills is also one of the skills
I expect to gain from CMSC 100.
